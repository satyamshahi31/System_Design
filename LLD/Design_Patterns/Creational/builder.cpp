// The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. 
// It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. 
// This pattern is especially useful when an object needs to be created with many optional parts or configurations.

// The Builder design pattern helps in creating complex objects by encapsulating the construction process, making it easy to manage and extend.

// The Decorator design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows for the dynamic addition of behavior to an object at runtime, 
// which is useful for adding new functionalities without altering the object itself.
